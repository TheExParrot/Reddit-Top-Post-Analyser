# Reddit-Top-Post-Analyser
A web scraping python program that analyses the post posts and comments of those posts of a subreddit and extracts data.

Enter the name of a subreddit that you want to analyse and returns a bar graph that summarises the popular words in the top posts and comment of that week. This script could be modified and ran over a longer period of time in order to reveal trend analysis on what topics are popular on particular subreddits.
